# Myopia-Data-Unsupervised-ML

In medical research, prediction models are highly sough out as a way to help diagnosis. I was interested in finding better ways to predict myopia, or nearsightedness. I used unupervised machine learning models to explore the possibility of predicting these outcomes more effectively.

In this project:

Data is prepared
Dimensionality reduction is applied
Cluster Analysis is performed by the use of K-means.
